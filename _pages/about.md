I am a Ph.D. student at the Aerospace and Mechanical Engineeirng Department of the University of Southern California, which I started in the Fall of 2020 as part of Professor Assad Oberai's researcj group. Recently, I started working as an intern researcher at Sandia National Labs in a group working on uncertainty quantification in machine learning and physics models.

The focus of my research is in the area of scientific machine learning, both in the application of machine learning to scientic problems as in the development of such methods. I am working in the application of conditional generative models to solve inverse problems in mechanics, particularly applied to medical imaging, such as ultrasound elastography. Also, I am working in the application of probabilistic deep learning methods for the detection of cancer-related cells in liquid biopsy images. Regarding method development, I have worked in the theoretical and practical improvement of conditional Generative Adversarial Networks.
